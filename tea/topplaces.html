<h3>1.
<mark>CHINA </mark>– 2,400,000 TONNES<br>
Unsurprisingly China is top of the charts as the spiritual home of the humble cuppa and tops the list as the world’s largest tea producing country.

China produces some 40% of the world’s tea weighing in at 2.4 million tonnes. It’s primarily grown in the provinces of Yunnan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang. While it’s the biggest exporter and grower of tea, 
China produces some of the best teas out there including Lapsang Souchong, Keemun and Green Gunpowder.<br><hr>
2. <mark>INDIA </mark>– 900,000 TONNES<br>
900,000 tonnes are produced in India annually making it the world’s second largest producer of tea with the crop being grown in bulk across Darjeeling, Nilgiri and Assam.

The crop was first introduced commercially by the British in 1824 to compete with neighbouring China’s tea production monopoly.<br><hr>
3.<mark>KENYA</mark> – 305,000 TONNES<br>
Asia doesn’t have it all its own way, as we head across the Indian Ocean to the top tea producing country in Africa, Kenya, which harvests just under 305,000 tonnes of tea each year. Kenya claims the accolade of the world’s top black tea producing country, with teas grown in the Kericho region, the Nyambene Hills and Nandi.

4.<mark>SRI LANKA</mark> – 300,000 TONNES<br>
Heading back to Asia and to Sri Lanka, which produces just under 300,000 tonnes, around 17% of the world’s tea crop grown in the central mountains.<br><hr>
5.<mark>TURKEY </mark>– 175,000 TONNES<br>
This time we find ourselves in the Middle East, specifically to Turkey, which historically sat squarely on the ancient trades routes between east and west. At number 5 on our list Turkey grows 175,000 tonnes of tea.<br>
