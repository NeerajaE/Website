<h1>Health benefits</h1>
<div> <u>Protecting the brain:<br></u>
Studies suggest that drinking three cups of black tea per day may help protect against diseases linked to brain such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.</div>
<div> <u>Heart health:<br></u>
Drinking black tea may reduce the risk of heart diseases and stroke. Studies showed that ginger, black pepper and cinnamon may help to support a healthy heart too.</div.><br>
<div> <u>Free radicals:<br></u>
Modern life is full of excesses of pollution, sun and stress. This leads in a rise of free radicals, a natural intermediate of the chemical processes in our body. Free radicals have been linked to diseases such as heart disease, stroke and cancer. And who should come to the rescue but our very own ….Tea. It is thought that regular consumption of food and drinks that are rich in free radical combating antioxidants can reduce the risks of the harm caused by free radicals. And tea is rich in a particular group of antioxidants known as Flavonoids</div>
<div><u>Hydration:<br></u>
The human body is over 65% water. The body uses water for many processes, like replacing cells, building blood plasma, lubricating joints and so much more. However the body also has many ways of losing this vital fluid. You need to keep hydrated and tea is a tasty way of doing just this.</div>
<div><u>Weight loss:<br></u>
The weight loss properties of tea are attributed to the presence of caffeine, a natural stimulant and catechins called epigallocatechin gallate or EGCG in them which combat fat absorption and speed up the body’s metabolism. The calorie burning properties of green tea have been very widely covered and talked about in the media. But the fact is that just as other health benefits of tea, even weight loss can be achieved from all teas rather than just green or white as they all come from the same tea plant Camellia sinensis</div>
