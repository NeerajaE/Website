Tandoori Chai is your same old Masala Chai with a twist, that gives it a nice earthy and smoky flavor making it even more amazing. You can serve this quirky chai to your guests and surprise them with its unique clay pot flavor.

Tandoori Chai is actually a very traditional way of making tea which was almost forgotten. A cafe in Pune brought the method back into practice and soon it became an internet sensation.

It is traditionally made by warming the kulhad (clay mugs) in a tandoor until they are red hot and then pouring the masala chai in them, hence the name Tandoori Chai. The tea froth vigorously like a volcano once poured in the hot kulhad and gets infused with the smoky flavor in the process.
